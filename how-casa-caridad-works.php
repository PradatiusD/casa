		<h2>How does it work?</h2>			
		<p>Our organization focuses on being of service throughout the year by distributing basic foods every month and offering blankets during the winter.  Every dollar that is donated goes toward purchase of these items.</p>  

		<h3>Monthly Grocery Distribution</h3>
		<p>Groceries are pre-ordered at the local supermarket, delivered to our food pantry and distributed to our recipients.  Currently, 32 families are served.  Each one of them is hand picked by our coordinator in Mexico.  Families are reviewed and evaluated on current living situation and financial need.</p>  

		<h3>Yearly Blanket and Toy Distribution</h3>
		<p>Two weeks into the winter season, traditional “tilma” blankets are purchased and distributed to about 300 needy adults and elderly from nearby rural areas.  On this day, children are not left out, around 500 toys are handed to them.  The timing of the distribution of blankets and toys serve as a “gift” from the “Magi” during the traditional Mexican holiday, or Epiphany.</p>
