		<h2>How we do it</h2>			
		<p>Our organization focuses on being of service throughout the year by distributing basic foods every month and offering blankets during the winter.  Every dollar that is donated goes toward the purchase of these items.  </p>  

		<h3>Monthly Grocery Distribution</h3>
		<p>Groceries are pre-ordered at the local supermarket, delivered to our food pantry and distributed to our recipients.  Currently, 32 families are served.  Each one of them is hand-picked by our coordinator in Mexico.  Families are evaluated on current living and financial situation and dependent on the need, help is extended.</p>  

		<h3>Yearly Blanket and Toy Distribution</h3>
		<p>At the beginning of every year , toys and traditional “tilma” blankets are purchased and distributed on January 6th to about 500 children, and 300 adults and elderly from nearby rural areas.  The timing of the distribution of blankets and toys serves as a “gift” from the “Magi” during the traditional Mexican holiday or Epiphany.</p>
