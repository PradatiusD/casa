				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Mexico, the second largest economy in Latin America, has a national poverty rate of 46%, mainly in urban areas, and an extreme poverty rate of 10.7%.  While over half of the population lives impoverished, the wealthiest 10% represents 40% of the countryâ€™s income and consumption.  Because of this significant discrepancy of wealth, the country suffers from severe inequality.  Additionally, those in poverty often are unable or have a difficult time accessing resources which frequently, as a consequence, leads many feeling powerless or insecurity.</p>
				<h3>Our Values</h3>
				<p>We have a great concern for the poor who are often forgotten in society, who have faced injustice, who suffer from inequality, who feel powerless and inadequate.</p>	
				<p>We believe in the need to give back to those who are much less fortunate than us.  With great respect, we do this by trying to alleviate some of the burdens of the poor who seek to live a life of dignity and hard work.</p>
				<h3>Mission</h3>
				<p>Casa Caridad provides basic needs to impoverished people in the central part of Mexico.</p>
